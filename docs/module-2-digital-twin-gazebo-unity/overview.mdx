# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Digital twins allow us to simulate robots in virtual environments before deploying to the real world. This module covers Gazebo (physics simulation) and Unity (high-fidelity rendering).

## What You'll Learn

- Setting up Gazebo for robotics simulation
- Creating URDF models for humanoid robots
- Integrating Unity for realistic rendering
- Sim-to-real transfer techniques
